#summary Where to set user preferences for IPTWeather?

Settings are in the weather.ini file.<br />
They are commented, but if you have some questions, I will answer to them with pleasure.<br />
You can easily change your location thanks to the manageIPTWLocation.mscr script.<br />
You can switch between your favorite locations quickly using the quickIPTWFavoriteLocationChange.mscr and setIPTWFavoriteLocation.mscr scripts.<br />
