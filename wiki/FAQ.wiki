#summary IPTWeather FAQ.

<b><font color="Green">Q: IPTweather have some bug, can update weather only several time after install, after this cant update at any time.</font></b><br />
A: Try restarting your device. It may happen sometimes that the MortScript is "locked" during the download process, thus resulting in not updating any more. I cannot do anything about that. It is a MortScript limitation.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="Green">Q: Could IPTWeather display in iPhoneToday a humidity icon?</font></b><br />
A: Yes, IPTWeather can do that thanks to the userScriptOnUpdate.mscr script wich allows the user to have some custom features. Please check the following link for [http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=6905046&postcount=523 full instructions on how to add this feature].<br />
<br />
<b><font color="Green">Q: I use IPTWeather My Location service or Google Latitude to retrieve the location for current weather, but it doesn't seem very accurate because it gives me the weather of a city like 30 km from my location, even if Google Maps can find my position about 500 meters from my current. What could be the problem? </font></b><br />
A: AccuWeather's database to translate GPS position into a city doesn't seem to be very accurate, but very approximative (around 30km). You cannot do anything but find the exact code of your location using the script manageIPTWLocation.mscr.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="Green">Q: I have configured the weather.ini file to display weather icons in iPhoneToday on a place where there is no icon. Nothing is displayed.</font></b><br />
A: If you want to have specific icons just for the weather and nothing else, you need to create blank icons in iPhoneToday. Because of the design of iPhoneToday, IPTWeather cannot create icons, but only update icons. The same rule applies if you want to have a page dedicated to weather icons.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="Green">Q: When I show the weather forecast icons in iPhoneToday, I can click on a day of the week. Instead of getting more information about that day, the icon opens the orignal application that iPhoneToday has under it.</font></b><br />
A: Indeed, the weather forecast icons are just a temp display, but the iPhoneToday icon is mapped with the original application.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="Green">Q: I have french (or something) shortnames for the days of the week. Jeu, Ven, Dim, etc.</font></b><br />
A: In your weather.ini file, change the settings IPTWmondayText, IPTWtuesdayText, ..., IPTWsundayText.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="Green">Q: I have moved the weather icon in iPhoneToday, but IPTWeather keeps updating the previous icon and not the new one!</font></b><br />
A: IPTWeather updates with the current weather the icon defined in the weather.ini file by the settings IPTWcurrentWeatherIcon and IPTWcurrentWeatherPage.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="Green">Q: What is the iPhoneTodayAccuWeather.mscr script for?</font></b><br />
A: This script expands temporarily, without modifying your icons.xml file, all weather forecast icons in iPhoneToday at first call. If you call it a second time, weather forecast icons are hidden and you come back to your icons.xml configuration.<br />
<br />

<br />
<b><font color="Green">Q: What is the setIPTFavoriteLocation.mscr script for?</font></b><br />

You may want to make copies of this script and editing each copy, to have for instance setIPTFavoriteLocation0.mscr, setIPTFavoriteLocation1.mscr, etc., each one allowing you to change your current location directly to your first, second, etc., favorite location.<br />
<br />
