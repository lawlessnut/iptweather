Settings are in the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/iptweather/wiki/Configuration'>weather.ini file</a>.<br />
You can configure all settings from the weather.ini file by running 'ITPWeather Config' shortcut from the Start Menu.
Settings are commented, but if you have some questions, I will answer to them with pleasure on the <a href='http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=603817'>xda thread</a>.<br />
You can easily change your location thanks to the manageIPTWLocation.mscr script or by running 'IPTWeather Location' from the Start Menu.<br />
You can switch between your favorite locations quickly using the quickIPTWFavoriteLocationChange.mscr and setIPTWFavoriteLocation.mscr scripts.<br />
